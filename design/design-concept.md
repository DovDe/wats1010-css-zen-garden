My concept is to create a simple clean site in which the content is clearly devided and easy to follow.
After going through many of the other design I noticed how hard it was to read a lot of the content and how distracting the design was.
My goal was to create a slick, neat, and clean design that helps the reader understand the content and read the information on the site. 
I built the site using multiple sections in order to clearly define each part of the site.
I also used muted colors, this was to help the user stay focused on the content and not be distracted by outside elements.
Through out the entire site will whenever a user hovers over a box or a specific element is will brighten.
This should help the user read the content and keep track of where they are on the page.
